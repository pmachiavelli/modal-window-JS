        A modal (also called a modal window or lightbox) is a web page element
        that displays in front of and deactivates all other page content. To
        return to the main content, the user must engage with the modal by
        completing an action or by closing it. Modals are often used to direct
        users‚Äô attention to an important action or piece of information on a
        website or application.
